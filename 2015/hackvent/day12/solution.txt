This provided code is too computationally expensive to complete in a reasonable time.

Looking at the code we can see that these functions are performing simple
tasks in very roundabout ways. We can try replacing these function calls with
the equivalent operation to drastically reduce the runtime.
Note of caution: doing the same thing but in a different manner can sometimes
produce different results!
Therefore we should run a few iterations of the main loop in both the original
and modified versions to compare the calculated value.

// foo   = a + 1
// bar   = a - 1
// baz   = a + b
// spam  = a - b
// eggs  = a * b
// merry = a / b
// xmas  = a % b
// hackvent = b to the power of a

In addition to factoring out the basic functions into the main calculation, we
only need to update the hackvent() value once every 42 iterations (i/42), and
even then we only need to multiply the current value by 3 to get the new value.

The solution.c code executes in under a second, giving the correct value...
